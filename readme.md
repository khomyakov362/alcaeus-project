# Alcaeus Project

## About the Project
    
The goal of this project is to give a larger audience access to a catalogue of classical books, 
available in human readable and machine readable format. 
All the books here are sourced from 
[github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit.git](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit.git)
which is a part of [Open Greek and Latin Project](https://www.opengreekandlatin.org/).
All the books are in TEI XML format. More about the format can be learnt
[here](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html).

## Features

- Books can be searched and filtered by title and author and ordered by title, author and year.
- Book can be read and download in the original XML and HTML, automatically generated by [teigarage.tei-c.org](https://teigarage.tei-c.org/).
- Books can be automatically searched on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and on [Scaife Viewer](https://scaife.perseus.org/) by CTS URN ID.
- Registered users can mark books as favourite.

    cd <your folder>
    git clone https://github.com/khomyakov362/a_drf_project.git
```
2. Create virtual environment:

```shell
    python -m venv ./venv
```

```

For Windows Powershell:
```shell
    .venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
```

5. Instal requirements:

For Linux:
```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Create .env file in the root directory based on .env_sample.

7. Optional --- Run TEIGarage in a Docker Container:

Running TEIGarage locally may significantly improve the speed of loading books to the database.
The command:
```shell
    docker pull ghcr.io/teic/teigarage:latest
```
You may refer to their documentation at [github.com/TEIC/TEIGarage](https://github.com/TEIC/TEIGarage/).

8. Optional --- Tweak .config/settings.py:

You may want to change some email related settings (lines 162 - 169). The settings given are for gmail.com.

If TEIGarage is run locally, change the TEIGARAGE setting at line 207 to your local hosting.

If you do not want to wait for all the books to load into the database, you may set the BOOK_LIMIT at line 212. 

9. Run the setupdb Command:

```shell
    py manage.py setupdb
```

If the settings are correct, everything should happen automatically.
You can read the documentation on each custom command in commands_doc.md.
Please, note: sending .xml files to be converted to HTML and loading books to the database 
may take about *1 - 1.5 hours* depending on your connection speed.

10. Run the development server:

```shell
    py manage.py runserver
```
