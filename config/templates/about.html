    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to give a larger audience access to a catalogue of classical books, 
        available in human readable and machine readable format. 
        All the books here are sourced from 
        <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit.git">
            github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit.git
        </a> which is a part of 
        <a href="https://www.opengreekandlatin.org/">
            Open Greek and Latin Project
        </a>.
        All the books are in TEI XML format. More about the format can be learnt 
        <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">here</a>.

    <h2>How to Read the Books?</h2>
    <p>
        Books are available to read and download in the original TEI XML and HTML format.
        (HTML Documents are generated with the help of
        <a href="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">teigarage.tei-c.org</a>).
        There is also some integration with <a href="https://archive.org/">The Internet Archive</a>:
        a book can be automatically searched from the Details tab.
        Most books can also be read on <a href="https://scaife.perseus.org/">Scaife Viewer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registered users can also mark some books as favourite to return to them later.
